Goals:

- Uniformity:
  - Everything is an object
    - The program itself is an object (homoiconity)
  - All objects are expressions (thus everything is an expression)
    - Value objects are expressions that return themselves
    - Expression objects are expressions which evaluate to something other
      than themselves
  - All objects are dictionaries (thus everything is a dictionary)
    - Dictionary keys are objects (not strings)
  - All objects are mailboxes (thus everything is an actor)
    - Objects can receive messages
    - Programs can send messages to objects

- Minimalism:
  - Minimal syntax, enough syntax to be expressive
    - No keywords
    - Infix, not prefix (lisp) or postfix (forth)
    - All infix expressions are evaluatable objects
    - Tree-structure inherit in syntax
  - Minimal builtin data types
    - so far: string, integer, float, object (table)

- Ease:
  - Readability - infix in spite of added parsing complexity
    - But the infix notation is just syntactic sugar, not an additional
      language element
  - Should be simple to expose a C function or C++ class to the VM

Open questions:

- What kinds of messages are there?  So far:
  - Function call - context push
  - Fiber - context switch
- Why separate mechanisms for attributes (table) and messages?
